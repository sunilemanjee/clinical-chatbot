## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7 or later
- Azure AI Services resources:
  - **Speech Service** (with TTS Avatar support)
  - **Azure OpenAI Service** 
  - **Cognitive Search** (optional, for medical knowledge base)

### Setup

1. **Clone and setup environment:**
```bash
# Create virtual environment
python3 -m venv avatar-env

# Activate virtual environment
source avatar-env/bin/activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. **Configure environment variables:**
Create a `variables.env` file with your Azure credentials:
```bash
# Speech Service
SPEECH_REGION=eastus2
SPEECH_KEY=your_speech_key_here
SPEECH_RESOURCE_URL=/subscriptions/your_subscription/resourceGroups/your_rg/providers/Microsoft.CognitiveServices/accounts/your_account

# Azure OpenAI
AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT=https://your-openai.openai.azure.com/
AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key_here
AZURE_OPENAI_DEPLOYMENT_NAME=gpt-4o

# Elastic
ELASTIC_URL="https://xxxxx.elastic.cloud:443"
ELASTIC_API_KEY="xxx"
```

3. **Run the setup script:**
```bash
# This script will load environment variables and prepare the application
source ./setup_env.sh
```

4. **Run the application:**
```bash
python -m flask run -h 0.0.0.0 -p 5000
```

5. **Access the application:**
- Clinical chat: `http://localhost:5000/chat`
- Basic demo: `http://localhost:5000/basic`

### Quick Test
To verify your setup is working correctly:
1. Open `http://localhost:5000/basic` in your browser
2. Click the microphone button and speak a simple phrase
3. Check that the avatar responds with speech and animation

### Available Regions
TTS Avatar is available in: Southeast Asia, North Europe, West Europe, Sweden Central, South Central US, East US 2, and West US 2.

### Key Components

**setup_env.sh**: Environment setup script that loads your Azure credentials and prepares the application environment.

**vad_iterator.py**: Voice Activity Detection module that processes real-time audio streams to detect when users are speaking, enabling more natural conversation flow.

## Data Ingestion

### Elasticsearch Integration

The application includes a data ingestion script to load clinical patient data into Elasticsearch for enhanced search capabilities and knowledge base functionality.

#### Ingest Clinical Data

1. **Prepare your data**: Place your clinical patient data in JSON format in the `data/` directory
2. **Configure Elasticsearch**: Ensure your `variables.env` file contains:
   ```bash
   ELASTIC_URL="https://your-cluster.elastic.cloud:443"
   ELASTIC_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"
   ```

3. **Run the ingestion script**:
   ```bash
   cd data/
   ./ingest_to_elasticsearch.sh
   ```

#### Script Features

- **Serverless Compatible**: Works with both regular and serverless Elasticsearch instances
- **Index Management**: Automatically deletes existing index and creates a fresh one
- **Field Mapping**: Properly maps clinical data fields for optimal search performance
- **Bulk Operations**: Efficiently ingests large datasets using Elasticsearch bulk API
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error checking and colored output for troubleshooting

#### Data Structure

The script expects JSON data with the following structure:
```json
[
  {
    "patient_name": "Jane Doe",
    "date_of_visit": "2023-01-15",
    "patient_complaint": "Persistent cough, low-grade fever, and fatigue",
    "diagnosis": "Acute bronchitis",
    "doctor_notes": "Patient presents with productive cough...",
    "drugs_prescribed": ["Mucinex"],
    "patient_age_at_visit": 35
  }
]
```

#### Elasticsearch Index Mapping

The script creates an index with optimized field mappings:
- **Text Fields**: `patient_complaint`, `doctor_notes` for full-text search
- **Keyword Fields**: `patient_name`, `diagnosis` for exact matching and aggregations
- **Date Fields**: `date_of_visit` with proper date formatting
- **Array Fields**: `drugs_prescribed` for medication searches
- **Numeric Fields**: `patient_age_at_visit` for age-based queries

#### Querying Your Data

After ingestion, you can search your clinical data using:
- **Elasticsearch API**: `GET /clinical-patient-data/_search`
- **Kibana**: Access through your Elasticsearch cluster dashboard
- **Application Integration**: Use the indexed data to enhance AI responses

## Clinical Configuration

### System Prompt for Clinical Use
Configure the system prompt in the chat interface for clinical scenarios:

```
You are a professional clinical assistant. Provide accurate, evidence-based medical information while always reminding users to consult with healthcare professionals for medical decisions. Focus on:

- Symptom assessment guidance
- General health information
- Medication information
- Preventive care recommendations
- When to seek immediate medical attention

Always emphasize that this is for informational purposes only and not a substitute for professional medical advice.
```

### Avatar Settings for Clinical Environment
- **Character**: Professional appearance (e.g., `lisa` with professional styling)
- **Voice**: Clear, professional tone
- **Background**: Clean, medical environment

## Performance Monitoring

The application provides real-time performance metrics:

- **AOAI Latency**: Time for Azure OpenAI to generate first sentence
- **TTS Latency**: Time from response received to avatar speaking
- **STT Latency**: Speech-to-text processing time
- **App Service Latency**: Application overhead

## Deployment

### Docker Deployment
```bash
# Build image
docker build -t clinical-chat-bot .

# Run container
docker run -p 5000:5000 --env-file variables.env clinical-chat-bot
```

### Azure Container Apps
1. Build and push Docker image to Azure Container Registry
2. Create Container App with environment variables
